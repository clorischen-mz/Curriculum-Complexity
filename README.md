Goal: Explore the relationship between curriculum complexity and study abroad participation across 50 majors at one large research institution.

To accomplish this goal, we first obtained data on study abroad participation for the years 2008-2018. We then identified the 48 largest majors at the university and entered their plans of study into the curriculum complexity online calculator to obtain a curriculum complexity score for each major. For majors that had significant changes in their plan of study during this time range, we entered the plan of study both before and after the change and averaged the curriculum complexity scores. We will next conduct correlation analyses to identify relationships between the curriculum complexity for these majors and studentsâ€™ participation in study abroad. We will also explore changes in study abroad participation over time (which are notable in some majors) and seek to understand programmatic factors that could explain these shifts. Our project can provide insights to engineering programs seeking to improve study abroad participation about the challenges that may arise from curriculum complexity and what strategies may help address this issue.
